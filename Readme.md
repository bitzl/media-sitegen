# media-sitegen - Generate simple static sites to share multimedia files

*Still very alpha aka "work in progress". Things might move, jump, explode or start singing Klingon opera. Use at your own risk.*

When collaborating on art projects (or just toying with some ideas as a group), I've often had the need to quickly share some audio and video files. As these files are usually small and many of them, all should be accessible from a single webpage.

This tool generates a static website with
 - HTML5 default viewers for all audio and video files in a single directory
 - links to all other files (so far also for images)
